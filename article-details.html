						Â¡BATMAN vuelve a salvar Gotham del ataque de los villanos!
					</div>
					<div class="complete-article">
						<p>I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men Iike this but I will not become an executioner.</p>
						<p>I'm not wearing hockey pads.</p>
						<p>Master Wayne, you've been gone a long time. You look very fashionable. Apart from the mud.</p>
						<p>I just the took to calling it the Bat. And yes Mr. Wayne, it does come in black.</p>
						<p>Are you so desperate to fight criminals that you lock yourself in to take them on one at a time ?</p>
						<p>Your anger gives you great power. But if you Iet it, it will destroy you as it almost did me.</p>
						<p>You know what you said about the structures becoming shackles. You were right and I can't take it, the injustice. I mean, no one ever's gonna know who saved the entire city.</p>
						<p>Are you so desperate to fight criminals that you lock yourself in to take them on one at a time ?</p>
						<p>I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful.</p>
						<p>Because some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just wanna watch the world burn.</p>
						<p>As Gotham's favored son you will be ideally placed to strike at the heart of criminality.</p>
						<p>Theatricality and deception, powerful agents to the uninitiated. But we are initiated aren't we, Bruce? Members of the League of Shadows. And you betrayed us.</p>
						<p>It means you're hatred, and it also means losing someone, who I've cared for since I first heard his cries echoing through this house. But it might also mean saving your life. And that is more important.</p>
						<p>Bane was a member of the League of Shadows. And then he was excommunicated. And any man who is too extreme for Ra's Al Ghul, is not to be trifled with.</p>
						<p>Perhaps you should read the instructions first?</p>
						<p>I speak for the rest of the board and Mr Wayne, in expressing our own excitement.</p>
						<p>Just know that there are those of us who care about what you do with your future.</p>
						<p>Speak of the devil, and he shall appear.</p>
						<p>You see, I'm a guy of simple taste. I enjoy dynamite and gunpowder and gasoline.</p>
						<p>I just want my phone call.</p>
						<p>There is a prison in a more ancient part of the world. A pit where men are thrown to suffer and die. But sometimes a man rises from the darkness. Sometimes, the pit sends something back.</p>
						<p>I think you and your friend have found the last game in town. where it hurts, their wallets. It's bold. You gonna count me in?</p>
						<p>A little the worse for wear, I'm afraid.</p>
						<p>Bruce... it's okay. Don't be afraid.</p>
